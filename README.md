SelectQL.js is inspired by Structured Query Language (SQL) for accessing and manipulating Objects in an easy and familiar way. It supports complex **Objects** and **Arrays** using Builder Design Pattern.

## Install

`npm install selectql.js --save`

## Usage
You may use Arrays like Objects to select and manipulate in well known SQL like syntax that uses builder patterns.

First include the library by `node` provided `require` keyword like:
`const { SelectQL, Operators } = require('selectql.js');`
    
  Client array like object, make sure to follow the syntax of banana in the box `[{}]` syntactic sugar:
    
    let cities = [
      { name: 'Los Angeles', population: 3792621, winner: 5 },
      { name: 'New York', population: 8175133, winner: 4 },
      { name: 'Chicago', population: 2695598, winner: 8 },
      { name: 'Houston', population: 2099451, winner: 9 },
      { name: 'Philadelphia', population: 1526006, winner: 1 },
    ];
    
    //Default object to be returned in case empty or null result.
    let denver = [{ name: 'Denver', population: 715522, winner: 8 }];

**Enum** should be followed in order to properly chain the functions.

|  Operator| Value  |
|--|--|
|  EQUAL| == |
|  NOT_EQUAL| != |
|  GREATER_THAN| > |
|  GREATER_EQUAL| >= |
|  LESS_THEN| < |
|  LESS_THEN_EQUAL| <= |


    enum Operators {
            EQUAL = '==',
            NOT_EQUAL = '!=',
            GREATER_THAN = '>',
            GREATER_EQUAL = '>=',
            LESS_THEN = '<',
            LESS_THEN_EQUAL = '<=',
    }

> Initialize the library by providing the objects of array and chain through the provided APIs

    let selectQl = new SelectQL(cities)
      .where('name', Operators.NOT_EQUAL, 'New York') // Will filter to make sure 'New York' should filtered
      .and('population', Operators.LESS_THEN, '5526006') // Will filtered the population less than 5526006
      .and('winner', Operators.GREATER_EQUAL, 15) // will only return if winner value more than 15
      .ifEmptyThen(denver) // if everything is empty, client can provide default object like array
      .build();
      
      console.log(selectQl, 'sq'); // Will returned denver array

## Client Chainable APIs:

 - **where(*key: any, operator: Operators, value: any*)**: As per SQL definition The WHERE clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. (this can be used multiple time)
  `.where('name', Operators.NOT_EQUAL, 'New York')`
 - **and(*key: any, operator: Operators, value: any*)**: where like function a predicate which will eventually use WHERE method (this can be used multiple time). ` .and('population', Operators.LESS_THEN, '5526006')`
 - **join(*concatWith: any*)**: Client can provide object like array to concat with the originally provided array. `.join(denver)`
 - **ifEmptyThen(*input: any*)**: if no condition met or null then client can return it's own input/object `.ifEmptyThen(denver)`
 - **build()**: builder function which is a must in order to return properly filtered array. `.build()`
